Web BCP

This is a web-based interface for BCP, the bulk copy utility for SQL Server.  It allows the import of multiple files into predefined, 
dynamically created tables.  It will import all files into one table or import each file into a separate table.   It was built with a 
view toward an n-tier implementation with the service project being deployed on a separate server.  It also is a good application for 
using async so there is a fair amount of it.

To setup, run the SQL in your database and change the connection strings.  There are some sample data files in the Data folder of the WebBCpUi project.

Have fun, and remember anything you learn is probably obsolete.
